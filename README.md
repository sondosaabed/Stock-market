# Stock Market
in this Java desktop project I have created GUI as list of buttons that user can chose from.
The progress of the operation will be updated on a progress label.
I also made it to input two files .txt and based on the files it saves the daily prices and the users stock shares.
The user is going to chose on radio buttons on what base they could work on their shares (accounting principle) either First in first out (FIFO) as Queue data structure, or Last in first out (FILO) as Stack data structure.
The operations "button" chosen will operate based on the 2 radio button user choices. 
And the program will calculate the capital gain for the sessoion, and enable the user to buy and sell shares, also to view their shares and the daily prices.
